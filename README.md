# My Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Notes

I find that every time I'm prepping for interviews, I find myself trying to find old notes, re-find the most common algorithms, and re-find common problems for those algorithms. It's a tedious process that I hope to solve for myself here: Make one set of (relatively) *good* [enough] notes that hits all the topics I have to look up every time DSA studying comes up.

I have decided to write them in LaTeX primarily because I have never used it and figured it would be a doubly good learning experience; all whilst making pretty documents.

Code samples are in Python, C++, and C (C when really a hashmap is not involved :D ).

Inclusions, thus far:

- Arrays and Hashmaps:
    - Binary Search
    - Sliding Window
    - Two Sum
    - Top K Frequent Elements
